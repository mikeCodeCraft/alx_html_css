Headphones Landing Page: A Responsive Design Project

This repository contains the front-end implementation (HTML and CSS) for a premium, responsive landing page dedicated to showcasing a high-fidelity line of headphones. The design is meticulously crafted to be visually stunning, featuring a dark, focused aesthetic (as seen in the hero section) and adhering strictly to professional design specifications.

Design Source & Specifications

The entire project is a direct implementation of a detailed design provided in Figma. All layout, typography, and color choices are derived from the source file.

Figma Project: 

Required Fonts: Source Sans Pro and Spin Cycle OT.

Mandatory Technical Constraints

The following critical rules must be enforced across the entire webpage:

Feature

Specification

Notes

Max Content Width

1000px

All main content is contained within this max width and is horizontally centered on the page.

Mobile Breakpoint

$\le 480 \text{px}$ screen width

The layout must switch to the optimized mobile design when the viewport is 480px or narrower.

Links Hover/Active

Color: #FF6565 (Red)

Applies to all navigation and text links (e.g., the top-right menu).

Button Hover/Active

Opacity: 0.9

A subtle, consistent interaction effect for all primary and secondary buttons (e.g., "CALL TO ACTION").

Figma Values

Float values were rounded.

All fractional measurements (paddings, margins, font sizes) extracted from the Figma file were rounded to the nearest integer for CSS implementation.
